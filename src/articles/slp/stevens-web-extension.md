# Stevens Web Extension

Project Lead: Adam Papenhausen

Repo: https://github.com/StevensSEC/stevens-web-extension

The Stevens Web Extension collects a bunch of useful tools for Stevens students. It automates tasks that are tedious to do manually through official Stevens websites.

During it's time as the active Semester Long Project, 3 club members made contributions to the repo:

- Adam Papenhausen (@adapap)
- David Carpenter (@carpenterd777)
- Carson McManus (@dyc3)
