        This slide will be sticky.
        
        Normally, you need to know the slide index ahead of time;
        however, now you can specify a custom name (ref) for when
        the slide will be sticky until.
        
        This will be sticky until the slide with ref `nail-polish-remover` is found.

      content: A slide does not need to contain a ref.

        Refs are only a QoL feature for people making slides. They are precomputed
        before rendering so that no duplicate refs exist and if in the future, the
        need to return to a previous slide arises.
        
        An example might be to reference a presentation by slide with a URL.
        `softe.club/slides/learn-git#making-a-pr` for example.
    - type: default
      content: I am the NAIL POLISH REMOVER SLIDE. NO MORE STICKY.
      ref: nail-polish-remover
    - type: default
      content: And that's how simple slide refs are!
