  slides:
    - type: title
      title: Quick Slides Demo
      subtitle: Automatically generate slide decks.
    - type: default
      content: |
          Default slides have 'content' that is parsed as markdown.<br>
          
          They can be *multiline*.
          
          ## BIG HEADER BOI
          You can embed <span style='color: yellow;'>HTML content</span> through markdown.
          This slide will be sticky for **1 slide** (excluding this one).
      sticky: 1
    - type: side-by-side
      content:
        left: |
          This content will be rendered on the left.
          It still renders **markdown** __properly__.
          
          Side-by-side slides are equal widths.
        right: |
          This is the right side.
          
          No, not the correct side.
          
          Are we talking about those airplane guys?

        Kind of weird having that sticky slide before.
        
        But I guess we support it.
        
        Now this slide will be sticky until the end!
      sticky: 2
    - type: default
      content: |
        If you forget to declare a slide type, I will yell it you.
    - type: default

        In summary, these are the rules for slides:
        - Choose from default, title, or side-by-side as `type`
        - For default slides, just add `content` which can support markdown
        - Title slides take `title` and `subtitle` text content
        - Side-by-side takes a content object: `content.left` and `content.right`
