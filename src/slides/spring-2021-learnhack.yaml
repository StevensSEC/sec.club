      # Open your terminal

      ### Windows
      - Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux

      OR
      - Press <kbd>windows + R</kbd>
      - Run `powershell`

      *Recommended: Install the Windows Terminal from the Microsoft app store.*
      **DO NOT USE GIT BASH.** It has only caused us problems. If you want bash on windows, install the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

      ### Mac
      - Open the terminal app

      ### Linux
      - Ubuntu: Press <kbd>ctrl + shift + T</kbd>

      # How to Navigate

      - When you start your terminal, it'll start in your user's home directory.

      Try changing the directory to your desktop:

      ```bash
      ls
      cd Desktop
      ls
      ```

      # Manage files

      ```bash
      mkdir learnhack
      cd learnhack
      touch test
      code .
      ```

      Edit the file and save it. Find the folder you just created in your file explorer/browser!
      Then,

      ```bash
      ls
      mv test test2
      ls
      cp test2 copied
      ls
      rm test2 copied
      ls
      ```

      Keep your terminal open for the next part!
