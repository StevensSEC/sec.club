# Resources

Learning about programming is hard. Hopefully, these resources will make it a little bit easier.

## How do I learn to code?

The best way to first learn how to code is with online tutorials or by taking E115. There are plenty of existing resources to teach the absolute basics. After that, the best way to learn new things is to do a project that uses those things. Do whatever you think is the coolest.

## What language should I learn?

It doesn’t matter. Once you’ve learned one programming language, it’s pretty trivial to apply that knowledge to another language.

Programming languages are tools. Different languages are good at different things, so it's important to pick the right tool for the job. You don't want to use a hammer on a screw.

## How do I start a project?

The best projects are the ones that solve a problem that you have and another solution doesn't exist yet, but those are generally hard to stumble upon.

If you are having trouble coming up with a project to work on, copy something that already exists. You don't have to finish it, as long as you learn something from trying to copy it.

# Recommended Resources for Beginners

Usually, the best resources are the official documentation, but sometimes beginners need a more guided overview. Here are some resources that we recommend for popular tools and languages.

## Web (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Git

Git is version control software. Using git is required for participating in the semester long project. If you don't know how to use git, we'll teach you.

## Linux

Even if you don’t develop on Linux, you will encounter it eventually. It’s definitely worth taking the time to learn how Linux works and how to navigate a Linux environment. We recommend installing a virtual machine or installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux, to play around with it.
