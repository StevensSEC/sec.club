# How to write new articles for the website

1. Add a new markdown file under `articles`
2. Add a route using the `Article` view that references the markdown file in `App.js`

## Images

Embed images with this syntax
```
![image text](PATH TO IMAGE)
```

Note that the path to the image is relative to the `assets` directory.

### Example

![image text](sec-logo.png)
